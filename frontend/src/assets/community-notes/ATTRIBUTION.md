# Game community note assets

The five game identity assets are local copies from the fixed reference
revisions below. They are used only in the daily-note cards.

- `arknights.png`: `gxy12345/arknights-plugin`
  (`3b6683cfe72a8379c8b3e4659c932cef572d7dae`),
  `resources/common/icon/amiya.png`, MIT, Copyright (c) 2023 gxy12345.
- `zenless.png` (historical stamina asset, not included in this migration or
  used as the game identity): `ZZZure/ZZZ-Plugin`
  (`a8a7037be8a5810624b6cf17a506512b65128ea4`),
  `resources/note/images/IconStamina.png`, GNU AGPL-3.0.
- `endfield.jpg`, `genshin.jpg`, `star-rail.jpg`, and `zenless.jpg`:
  `yoshino-xiao7/A-game_checkin`
  (`f8611120b433ece71fbce160a0950f5690386559`),
  `resources/reward/icons/game/{endfield,genshin,star-rail,zenless}.jpg`,
  MIT as declared by `package.json`.

The selected Endfield and Miyoushe-specific fixed revisions do not contain a
redistributable bitmap asset with a confirmed license, so the MIT game-icon
assets above are used for those fallback cards. Protocol and rendering
behavior were separately reviewed against the game-specific reference
projects recorded in the development report. The source project names,
revisions, paths, and license information are preserved here; no reference
repository is bundled into the application.

The following card background files were supplied by the requester for this
change on 2026-09-04. Their original source and redistribution license were not
included with the files. Copyright remains with the respective rights holders;
redistribution permission must be confirmed before a public release.

On 2026-09-07 the requester identified these backgrounds as public materials
from the respective game Wikis and selected the AUTO-MAS documentation site
for distribution. Specific Wiki page URLs and image license records have not
yet been provided; public accessibility alone does not establish a license.
The original PNG provenance is recorded below for traceability; the PNGs are
not included in this application checkout. WebP derivatives are maintained in
`AUTO-MAS-docs/public/community-notes/`, together with their source
notice and conversion manifest, and served at
`https://doc.auto-mas.top/community-notes/` after the docs are published.

The following notice is copied from `arknights-plugin` and applies to
`arknights.png`. The pinned `A-game_checkin` revision declares MIT in
`package.json` but does not include a separate license file or copyright
notice; its repository, revision, and asset paths are preserved above.
